# CornCycle

In 2025, humanity faces an urgent challenge in the digital age, where the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds are rapidly fading. The threat is no longer just a matter of cyberspace warfare; it has spilled into the real world, where speed and precision are now a matter of survival.

Once a cutting-edge tool of high-speed digital combat, lightcycle technology was thought lost to time. But from the ashes of a forgotten experiment, this powerful technology has been resurrected. No longer confined to the neon trails of cyberspace, lightcycles now race through the real world, creating chaos and testing the limits of human skill and strategy.

The problem is clear: only the sharpest minds and the steadiest hands can master this new reality. The world is on the brink of destruction unless skilled pilots can harness the power of lightcycles and navigate this high-speed battlefield. The question is: can you rise to the challenge and ride the light, or will you be consumed by the very technology you seek to control?

# Overview
CornCycle is a unique, in-person recreation of the iconic Tron Lightcycle game, brought to life for CornHacks 2025. CornCycle transforms a traditional digital game into a physical experience by combining computer vision, embedded systems, and interactive projection. Players control custom-built RC cars with Wii remotes while avoiding digital light trails projected onto the table surface.

# Technologies Used
* Pygame – Graphics rendering and game mechanics

* OpenCV – Computer vision for tracking objects in real-time

* Xbox Kinect – Player tracking and environment awareness

* Ceiling Tile Projector – Displays the game grid and light trails on the table

* RC Cars – Custom-built vehicles representing the lightcycles

* Wii Remotes – Player input for controlling the RC cars

# The Ceiling Tile Projector
Our mounting solution to get projection on our surface was very unique to say the least. A trip to Home Depot the night before the hackathon before provided us our own ceiling tiles for custom modification. We ended up utilizing lots of duct tape to get our projector and Kinect 9 feet high. The building's existing ceiling tile was taken away so we would not damage it. We did not damage anything we did not own and also ensured we returned the room to its state before our project.
